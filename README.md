# UnlockClock

After watching Snazzy Labs new video, [Do NOT Buy a 'Minimalist' Phone!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnLP5MORQpc&t=805s) one statistic stuck with me:  
**"Americans reach for their phones every 2.5 minutes."**

I wanted to know: when did I last reach for my phone? So I made this app.

**UnlockClock** is a small Android utility that shows, on your Lock Screen, how long it's been since you last unlocked your phone. Every time I reach for my phone now, I see a quiet reminder of how recently I did the same thing - and it makes me pause.

Itâ€™s not meant to guilt you. Just a little reflection.
